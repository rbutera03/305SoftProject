# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members of the team, pledge to create and uphold a respectful, collaborative, and inclusive environment 
for everyone involved. We are committed to ensuring that participation in our community remains a positive and 
harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, 
gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, 
race, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

The following behaviors are expected and contribute to a positive and productive environment:
-Demonstrating empathy, kindness, and respect towards all team members.
-Being mindful and respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
-Providing constructive feedback and being open to receiving it.
-Accepting responsibility, apologizing when necessary, and learning from mistakes.
-Prioritizing the success of the overall project and team over individual outcomes.
-Maintaining professionalism in communication channels and in-person meetings.

Unacceptable behaviors include:
-The use of offensive or inappropriate language, sexualized imagery, or unwelcome advances.
-Trolling, harassment, derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
-Sharing others' private information without permission.
-Any behavior that disrupts the team's workflow or violates a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

All team members are responsible for upholding and promoting this Code of Conduct. The Scrum Master has additional 
responsibilities to monitor compliance and address any issues that arise. If necessary, team leaders may implement 
corrective actions to resolve violations.

## Decision-Making

Majority Rule: Decisions will be made by majority vote. In the case of a tie, the Scrum Masterâ€™s vote counts as two votes.

## Attendance

Mandatory Attendance: Attendance is required for all CSC305 classes and scheduled Scrum meetings. If a team member cannot 
attend an external team meeting, they should inform the group ahead of time. Meetings should be scheduled when all members 
are available.

## Assignments

Sprint-based Approach: All tasks and project components will be managed and completed in sprints, adhering to the agile 
development methodology.

## Technology Use Policy

Focus and Attention: As per the 305Soft policy, all team members are required to keep their technology usage focused on the meeting 
at hand. Distracted use of phones or other devices is prohibited during all team meetings and class sessions. Members should keep
phones away unless they are specifically needed for the discussion. Violation of this policy will be handled through a warning system 
and discussed during the sprint retrospective if it continues.

## Participation

Communication and Engagement: Participation is required through platforms such as Discord, text, and in-person meetings. 
Members should communicate their strengths and weaknesses to ensure tasks are assigned accordingly. If no member is confident 
in handling a task, the team should collaborate to decide who will take it on. Every member is expected to pick at least one 
Product Backlog Item (PBI) card.

## Communication Etiquette

Open Discussions: If a conversation is derailed for more than 5 minutes, any member can redirect the discussion to keep 
meetings on pace. Ensure every member can voice their opinions before final decisions are made.

## Roles and Responsibilities

Agenda and Minutes: Meeting notes and minutes will be documented and managed by Ryan Butera.  In the event of his absense
a new meeting notes and minutes taker will be assigned.

## Punctuality

Timeliness: No lateness will be tolerated. Instances of lateness will be managed according to CSC305Soft policy.

## Feedback and Retrospectives

Equal Voice: Every team member has an equal voice in shaping and enforcing the rules. Feedback will be discussed during 
sprint retrospectives or in private messaging as needed.

## Enforcement Guidelines
Instances of unacceptable behavior will be addressed according to the following escalation steps:

    Correction
    Impact: Use of unprofessional or inappropriate language or behavior.
    Consequence: A private, written warning, with an explanation of the violation and a request for a public apology, if necessary.

    Warning
    Impact: A single incident or repeated behavior that violates the code of conduct.
    Consequence: A warning that specifies the consequences for continued behavior, and a request to avoid further interaction with involved parties for a designated time. Continued violations may result in a temporary or permanent ban.

    Temporary Ban
    Impact: A serious violation or sustained inappropriate behavior.
    Consequence: A temporary ban from team communication channels and meetings for a specified period. Violations during this period may result in a permanent ban.

    Permanent Ban
    Impact: Persistent violations, harassment, or harmful behavior that disrupts the community.
    Consequence: Permanent exclusion from all team activities and interactions.

## Enforcement and Reporting

If any team member witnesses or experiences violations of this Code of Conduct, they should report it to the Scrum Master or another designated leader. 
Reports will be handled with confidentiality and fairness. 
All team leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all team interactions within and outside the official team spaces, including meetings, online communication, and representation at events. 
Members representing the team in any capacity are expected to uphold these standards.
